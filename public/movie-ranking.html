<h1>The Best Disney Movies According to Debbie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ratatouille</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Disney movie because a rat can actually cook. A lesson there is anyone can cook.</p>
<h3>The Princess and the Frog</h3>
<p>I also love this movie because Tiana is a hardworking person, she works really hard for her dreams and wants to achieve it no matter what.</p>
<h3>UP!</h3>
<p>This one of my favorite movie. The old man is very adventurous and his dream is to go to Paradise Falls since he was little.</p>
